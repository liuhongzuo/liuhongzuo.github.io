Here’s a way you could present your case:

"I believe our new project has significant potential to drive innovation and improve our overall product offering. To fully capitalize on this opportunity, I recommend allocating additional resources. With more support, we can accelerate the development process, explore advanced features, and ensure the final product is of the highest quality. Investing more resources now will not only increase our chances of success but also position us ahead of competitors in the market. I’m confident that with the right support, this project can deliver substantial returns and reinforce our leadership in the industry." 

This approach emphasizes the benefits of investing in the project and how it aligns with the company's strategic goals.
