Here’s a longer version of the conversation:

**You:** We’ve been discussing adding a new feature to our smartphone that will enhance both security and user experience.

**Colleague:** That sounds promising, but won’t that increase production costs?

**You:** Yes, it will. Because of the additional cost, we’d have to raise the product price to maintain our margins.

**Colleague:** I see. Do you think raising the price will affect sales? Not all customers are willing to pay more.

**You:** That’s what we’re concerned about too. But we analyzed our historical data, and it shows that in certain regions, customers have a higher purchasing power. These customers tend to value additional features and are willing to pay more for them.

**Colleague:** So, the idea is to introduce the new feature only in those specific regions where people are more likely to pay extra?

**You:** Exactly. By doing that, we can justify the price increase in those markets without affecting our overall global pricing strategy. We’ll maintain the standard version in regions where pricing is more sensitive.

**Colleague:** That makes a lot of sense. It’s a good balance between offering premium features and managing cost. Which regions are we thinking of targeting?

**You:** Primarily regions like North America and Western Europe, where customers have historically been more willing to invest in premium features.

**Colleague:** Sounds like a solid plan. We’ll need to tailor the marketing in those regions to emphasize the benefits of the feature, so customers understand why it’s worth the extra cost.

**You:** Exactly. We’ll need to highlight both the improved security and the enhanced user experience to make it appealing. 

**Colleague:** Agreed. We should also involve the sales team to make sure they understand the value proposition for those markets.

**You:** Absolutely. I’ll start preparing a proposal for management, and we’ll need their approval before we move forward. Let’s also gather feedback from the regional teams.

**Colleague:** Good idea. Let’s get everything ready so we can have a strong case for adding this feature in those regions.

**You:** I’ll schedule a meeting with finance and the marketing teams to align on the next steps. Thanks for your input!
