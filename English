My name is Rick, I have four years of experience in UI design. I'm expert at creating user-friendly interface. And I am skilled in using many software, such as Adobe, Figma and Sketch.

Well, technology is important, but I think our product should focus on user experience. With more support, we can explore more advaned features for users. You will find that the investment is worth it.

I think we should adjust our direction in time. Because technology is updating too fast now. We should not waste resourees on the wrong direction, otherwise we will easily fall behind other companies.

I have always been concerned about cutting-edge theories and I'm very good at applying theories to product. If i join this project, I will push it forward quickly.
